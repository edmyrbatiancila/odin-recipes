                    <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add remaining 1/4 cup flour if dough is too sticky.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a greased pizza pan.</li>
                    <li>Add your favorite toppings, and bake. Enjoy!</li>
